/**
 * Write a GUI Blackjack program that lets the user play a game of Blackjack, with the computer
 * as the dealer. The program should raw the user's cards and the dealer's cards. Add the following
 * rule to the description:
 *
 * If a player takes five cards without going over 21, that player wins immediately. This rule is used
 * in some casinos. For your program, it means that you only have to allow room for five cards. You should
 * make the canvas just wide enough to show five cards, and tall enough to show both the user's hand and
 * the dealer's hand.
 *
 * Note that the design of the GUI Blackjack game is very different from the design of the text-oriented
 * program that you wrote previously. The user should play the game by clicking on "Hit" and "Stand"
 * buttons. There should be a "New Game" button that can be used to start another game after one game ends.
 * You have to decide what happens when each of these buttons is pressed. You don't have much chance of
 * getting this right unless you think in terms of the states that the game can be in and how the state can
 * change.
 *
 * Your program will need the classes defined in Card.java, Hand.java, Deck.java and BlackjackHand.java. It
 * will also need the images file cards.png, which contains pictures of the cards.
